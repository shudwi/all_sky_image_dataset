# All-Sky Image Dataset Gallery

This project showcases an **All-Sky Image Dataset**, a collection of images capturing the entire visible portion of the sky using fisheye or wide-angle lens systems.

These images are valuable for applications such as:
- **Solar energy forecasting**
- **Atmospheric research**
- **Cloud pattern analysis**
- **Radiative transfer modeling**

At present, this repository serves as a **gallery interface** to browse the captured images.  
In the future, we plan to include:
- Sky condition analytics
- Solar irradiance estimation
- Weather classification insights using computer vision and machine learning

## Features
- Publicly viewable gallery of sky images
- Simple, clean interface for browsing
- High-resolution full-dome sky coverage

## Coming Soon
- Sky condition tagging (clear, cloudy, overcast)
- Time-series analysis tools
- Downloadable metadata and statistics
