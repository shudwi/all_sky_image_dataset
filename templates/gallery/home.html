  <h2 class="mb-4">All-Sky Imaging Observations at Maitri and Bharati Stations, Antarctica</h2>

  <div class="row mb-4">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>Continuous All-Sky Imaging (ASI) observations are being conducted at the Maitri and Bharati research stations 
        in Antarctica, operated by the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR). These observations form 
        a critical component of ongoing atmospheric and space weather research programs, with a specific focus on 
        high-latitude geophysical processes, particularly auroral dynamics and magnetosphere–ionosphere coupling.</p>

      <p>The collected datasets facilitate detailed investigations into the onset and evolution of auroral substorms, 
        and provide key insights into the physical mechanisms governing the transport of energy and charged particles 
        from the magnetosphere into the polar ionosphere and thermosphere. These interactions play a significant 
        role in space weather variability and have direct implications for ionospheric conductivity, particle 
        precipitation, and electromagnetic energy dissipation at high latitudes.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Scientific Objectives</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Monitoring Auroral Activity</b> 
        To characterize the spatial and temporal variability of auroral activity in response to solar 
        wind–magnetosphere interactions, and to quantify their impact on ionospheric electrodynamics 
        and upper atmospheric energy balance.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Substorm Onset and Magnetospheric Coupling</b>
        To investigate the trigger mechanisms and morphological features of auroral 
        substorm onset, and to examine the associated magnetospheric energy transfer 
        processes, including field-aligned currents, particle precipitation, and auroral 
        arc dynamics in the polar ionosphere.</p></li>
      </ul>
